ASongADay

This app is not related to https://www.asongaday.co/
It's my own implementation of the same idea.

Android application commissioned by Fontys Hogeschool ICT 2015-2016.

Summery:
Android application which let's you explore new music.
You can rate every song with smileys, based on that rating a personal profile will be build to give you personalized suggestions.

Features:
- Register/Login service (using database)
-Scratchview, so you can judge the song by it's sound, not the artist, name, or description 
-Music stream from web

Todo:
- rate-by-smileys implementation
- create song database, and display in recyclerview
- Optimize music streaming, implement buffer.
- Spotify - youtube - soundcloud, reference implementation
